* *Custom Symbols* is a custom webfont created using [fontello](http://fontello.com/), aggregating some symbols from [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) ([SIL](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)),
  [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/) ([CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)) and [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/) ([SIL](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)).

Any or all the fonts mentioned above might have been put through [fontsquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) to reduce size and remove unused char subsets.

The "Stackoverflow favicon" Icon that appears in *Custom Symbols* was done manually by myself using Inkscape. It's licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The raw SVG format can be found here:

* [Colored Icon](/img/stackoverflow-favicon.svg)
* [Merged Monochrome](/img/stackoverflow-favicon-font.svg) (useful for fonts)
