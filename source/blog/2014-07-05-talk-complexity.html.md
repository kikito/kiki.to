I recently gave a talk in [ASPgems](http://aspgems.com) about complexity.

The type of complexity I referred to was complexity in code; what makes a certain piece of code "difficult to understand" to a human.

The conclusion I arrived is that in order to make code easier for us we must know ourselves first. In particular, I concentrated on
the areas where the human brain excels, and the ones where it doesn't.

I leave my slides below. They are hosted in google drive. If you want, you can use the âš™ menu to download it in some formats (like PDF).

As usual with my presentations, they are almost all images, so they might not be very useful if you were not in the talk. Sorry about that!
