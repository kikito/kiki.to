title: "Talk: OOD with Ruby"
date: 2015-04-30

The following talk is about Object Oriented Design in Ruby. I based it in the
[POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) book.

As usual, the slides alone can only give you a rough idea of what I talked about.

The structure of the talk was: first an introduction ("what do we mean by design"),
then 3 parts that I liked about the book (responsibility, dependencies, messages)
and then a conclusion.

This by no means should be considered a comprehensive presentation - on the
contrary, the intention was for it to serve as an introduction. Some of the
subjects I barely touched, if at all, where duck types, modules, and testing.
If you liked my talk, I *strongly* recommend buying POODR and reading it from
cover to cover.

I gave this talk twice in a short period of time:

* In CÃ³rdoba, [at the Betabeers group](https://betabeers.com/event/betabeers-cordoba-xix-5-marzo-2015-2497/) (March 2015)
* In Madrid, [at Madrid.rb](http://www.madridrb.com/events/abril-2015) (April 2015)

This is the first time I repeat a talk, and I understand now why people do it. The second time was just better.

The talks where in Spanish, and both were taped. I will put them here when they are available.

EDIT: Here's the video (warning: Spanish)
