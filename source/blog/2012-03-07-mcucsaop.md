Programming is full of acronyms:
[KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
[TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
[OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) .
[YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain't_gonna_need_it) .

In other cases there are short idioms for common concepts: [Premature
optimization is the Root of All
Evil](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization) and [GOTO considered
harmful](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GotoConsideredHarmful)

Well, here’s one little programming principle for which I have not found
a popular acronym or short idiom:

> Make the common use case simple, and the others possible.

a.k.a. `MCUSAOP`

It’s a programming principle I keep coming back every time I’m
developing a library. I like it is very adequate for that task; the
steps to follow are clear: first, find the most common case, or estimate
which one is it. Then, design an interface for doing it in the simplest
possible way. Then, think about the next most common case, and add an
interface for it, trying to minimize its impact on the first case’s
design. Keep doing that until all cases are covered.

MCUSAOP FTW!
