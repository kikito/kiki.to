This is not the first time I hear about the "I don't like using
libraries" thing, and I have been thinking about it for a while. I guess
this is a good place to expose my views on the matter.

You see, for me there are two kinds of tasks in programming: there is
**Cool Stuff** and there is **Yak Shaving**.

In a game, **Cool Stuff** is what your game is about - it could be a
great gameplay. It could be a really neat set of graphics. It could be a
really good story. Or very likable characters. Hell, it could be the
sound, if you are doing a musical game.

But there is usually lots of extra stuff that you also need for your
game to be considered "complete". You need to handle the menu. The
animations. You need to store and retrieve information from files, etc.

All that stuff that "doesn't really make your game any cooler, but it's
still needed", is **Yak Shaving**.

The problem is that lots of people (me included) end up not doing the
Cool Stuff because they spend all their energy Yak Shaving. That is just
sad.

In my opinion, anything that saves you from Shaving a Yak so you can
spend time doing **Cool Stuff**, is good.

An example: you are using LÖVE instead of C++ and OpenGL, or direct
machine code. And yet it doesn't "feel like cheating". That's because
all LÖVE does is Yak Shaving. But you still need to do your part - you
need to do the Cool Stuff!

In the "cross the country metaphor", using tween should not feel like
friend giving you a lift. It should feel like a friend giving you a pair
of good walking boots. You put them on and then, off you go! You are
still doing the important stuff - which is walking that long, long path.
It's only that now you don't have to worry about all the little pointy
pebbles in the way.

I also want to address the *"but if I use libraries, I will not
learn!"* concern.

First of all, I think learning is great. I'm all for learning. And I think that it is a proven fact that learning from others is more effective than having to learn it by yourself. A good teacher will explain the Theory of relativity in one hour. A class full of students, however bright they are, will forcefully take much longer than that to come up with the theory all by themselves.

If you want to learn, that is great) Just don't try to go "macho" and do
it on your own. Open up an existing lib, and see how other people have
already done it! Don't try to invent relativity, read a book about it!
Be efficient!

I've learnt so much by reading other people's source code. I make a o
point to make my libs as understandable as possible, just because of
this.

That's pretty much it. Sorry for the long rant. I will shut up now.
