title: "Talk: Complex APIs"

This talk is another take about [my talk about Complexity](/blog/2014/07/05/talk-complexity/), but
this time I concentrated in Complexity in Web APIs, while the other one was "Complexity in programming".

The talk is centered around users: in the introduction I speak about how they think, in the first
half I give some general design guidelines, and in the second half I divide users into groups,
and give some UX tips adapted to each group.

I gave this talk to the "Adobe API Group". They contacted me via email to see if I could adapt my talk
(they explicitly said so).

The experience was unusual for me for several reasons: first, this was the first time I was asked to
give a talk about a specific subject. Until now, I had picked the subjects completely. It was a
bit of a challenge, but I enjoyed it.

The other surprising thing was the presentation setup. It was a teleconference, which is ok.
I was told that people would listen to the talk from their homes or offices, but they would not
connect their webcams. So I would present to an undetermined amount of strangers without even seeing
their faces. It was also recommended that I didn't share my webcam, so they would not see my face either.

I am used to at least some degree of body language between me and my audience, so I got the
"I am talking to a wall" feeling, especially at the end, after talking alone for 40 minutes. It
didn't feel like doing a presentation; it felt like doing a screencast (and I don't have experience
doing those).

Nevertheless, the feedback I got was good. I was told that it was "A non-technical talk for technical people",
despite the fact that parts of the talk where really technical. I want to think that I did such a good job at
making them easy to understand that they seemed non-technical. The alternative is that I didn't get my message
across, and I don't want to think that.

I was also told that this talk was Conference-worthy. We'll see.
