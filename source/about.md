# Hi, I'm **Enrique Garc√≠a Cota**

By day, I am a web developer.

By night, I am also a web developer.

## Ruby

I've been programming in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) since 2010. I manage the [Madrid.rb](https://madridrb.jottit.com/) group.

## Lua

Recently I have been working on [Lua](http://www.lua.org) with [nginx](http://nginx.org), using the [OpenResty](http://openresty.org) distribution for [3Scale](http://3scale.net).

## More

If you want to see a sample of my work, please give a look to my [github profile](https://github.com/kikito).

I tweet about technical things in [@otikik](https://twitter.com/otikik).
